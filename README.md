# Airline Reservation System
This project was based on creating an airline ticket reservation system. The system includes mainly two different accessibility levels. One for seat reservation agents and other for Admin. The system also enriches with three different languages(localization and Internationalization). Seat booking agents can mainly do booking flights based on different dates and times by taking reservation details by customers and they can reserve any seat for customers by looking at the seat reservation chart. After the reservation, they can get personal details of the customer and continue the payment. Once the payment is completed the customer will receive an online message and ticket through the email with all the information required to the flight.

As an Admin he can manage all the flights by adding new flight plans and he can also manage the seats in the plane, he can do any change he wants to the system database through his interfaces. He also can view reports and comparison charts generated by the system too. The system also includes two separate log files to view customer booking details and system user login details with time.
